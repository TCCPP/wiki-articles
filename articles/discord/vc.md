# Voice chat

In general, **most users here won't help in voice chat**. Instead, you must take time to type up a clear summary of your
problem / question and minimal reproducible example and make it as easy as possible for folks to help you.

## Why?

We know it's tempting to ask to just go over the problem in voice chat, and it may very well be quick to do and easier
that way. However, all the folks helping out here are volunteering their time to help others and it's a big ask for them
to hop on a call to take dedicated time to hold your hand through a problem. Additionally, many users don't have a
microphone handy or aren't in a place where they can join a voice call.
